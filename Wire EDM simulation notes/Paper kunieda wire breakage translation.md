## Abstract
In wire electrical discharge machining (WEDM), wire breaking is a significant issue as it reduces machining efficiency. This study used transparent electrodes to observe gap phenomena at the moment of wire breaking. It was observed that discharge points concentrate before wire breaking. Additionally, plasma movement during concentrated discharge differed between brass wires and zinc-coated wires.

## 1. Introduction
In WEDM, wire breakage reduces machining efficiency, making it essential to understand the phenomena leading to wire breaking. Takashita et al. (1997) measured the temperature distribution of wire electrodes during machining and found that discharge concentration is a factor in some wire breaks. However, visual observation of wire breaking has not been reported.

Kitamura et al. (2014) used transparent SiC single-crystal wafers as electrodes in sinker EDM to observe phenomena such as plasma and bubbles between electrodes. This study applies transparent electrodes in WEDM to capture the wire breaking process and investigate the progression from concentrated discharge to wire breakage.

## 2. Experimental Method
The experimental setup is shown in **Fig. 1**. A high-speed video camera was used to observe gap phenomena through an acrylic window installed in the machining water tank. The machining equipment was a Sodick AP200L WEDM machine using deionized water as the dielectric fluid. The electrodes included a 380 µm thick transparent SiC single-crystal wafer (anode) and a 200 µm diameter brass wire (cathode).

The wire electrode was scanned toward the high-speed video camera, allowing direct observation of plasma and bubbles through the SiC wafer. The high-speed camera settings are listed in **Table 1**, and machining conditions are summarized in **Table 2**.

### Table 1: High-Speed Camera Settings
| Parameter           | Value       |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Resolution          | 320×480 pixels |
| Frame Rate          | 50,000 fps  |
| Exposure Time       | 1/50,000 s  |

### Table 2: Machining Conditions
| Parameter           | Value       |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Peak Current [A]    | 11          |
| Discharge Duration [µs] | 1      |
| Pause Duration [µs] | 4           |
| Open-Circuit Voltage [V] | 75    |

To encourage wire breakage, the SiC wafer's vertical width was reduced to 1 mm, and the pause time was set to approximately the plasma quenching time (4 µs).

## 3. Observation Results

### 3.1 The Moment of Wire Breakage
**Fig. 2** shows the moment of wire breakage during machining with a flushing flow rate of 8 L/min. Discharge concentrated at a single point approximately 140 µs before the wire broke. Despite flushing from the upper and lower nozzles, bubbles near the discharge concentration area remained around the wire and were not expelled. In all 15 experiments, concentrated discharge occurred before wire breakage.

### 3.2 Concentration of Discharge Points
The concentration of discharge points was observed as a precursor to wire breaking. Plasma movement during concentrated discharge was analyzed, as shown in **Fig. 3**. Plasma was seen moving along the surface of the SiC wafer, suggesting it slid over the SiC while remaining fixed on the wire electrode.

The relationship between the wire feeding speed and plasma movement speed was investigated for brass and zinc-coated wires, as shown in **Fig. 4**. For brass wires, the plasma moved at the same speed as the wire feed rate. For zinc-coated wires, the plasma slid along both electrodes, reducing the duration of concentrated discharge on a single point and making wire breakage less likely.

## 4. Summary
- The gap phenomena at the moment of wire breaking were directly observed. Concentrated discharge always occurred immediately before wire breakage, and bubbles and plasma points were not easily expelled during this time.
- With brass wires, plasma moved at the same speed as the wire feed rate along the SiC surface. In contrast, with zinc-coated wires, plasma slid across both electrodes, reducing the duration of discharge concentration and decreasing the likelihood of wire breakage.
