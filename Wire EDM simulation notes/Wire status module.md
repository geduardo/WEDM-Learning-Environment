## Collecting facts

- The main limiting factor limiting cutting speed in rough cut Wire EDM is the power that can be delivered through the wire electrode without causing it to break. Therefore, modelling wire breaking is essential for a simulation focused on control of wire EDM main cut
- The wire can break for several reasons. In order of importance (Schaat thesis)
	- The wire gets too hot, the mechanical properties of the wire change at some local point that causes it to break. This can happen through several mechanisms:
		- Ductile fracture with a strong reduction of wire diameter due to elevated wire temperature
		- Complete melting of the wire
	- Brittle fracture of the wire without reduction of the diameter, likely due to initiation and propagation of cracks during the spark explosion. This kind of rupture can also happen after the wire has left the working area (e.g. bending in the evacuation system)
- Most wire breakages are not preceded by a concentration of sparks (kunieda)
- Some wire breakages are preceded by a concentration of sparks (kunieda)
- There are two main sources of heating in the wire: (Schaat thesis)
	- Thermal energy from the plasma during the discharge (main source in thicker wires)
	- Joule effect in the wire (relevant in thinner wires)
