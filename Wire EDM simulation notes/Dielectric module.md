   - The temperature of the dielectric fluid increases.``

   - The dielectric fluid becomes ionized.``

   - Debris from the material removal process are dispersed in the dielectric fluid.``

   - Bubbles might form.``

All these changes affect the process and the control system:`

   - The temperature of the dielectric fluid affects the properties of the wire and it's likehood of breaking.``

   - The ionization of the dielectric fluid affects the ignition process.``

   - The debris also affect the ignition process and can cause short circuits.``

   - Bubbles facilitate sparking and reduce wire cooling, increasing the likelihood of wire breakage.``
