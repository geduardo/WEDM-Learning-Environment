# Wire Electrical Discharge Machining (WEDM) Simulation Environment

This Python-based simulation environment aims to emulate the Wire Electrical Discharge Machining (WEDM) process, with a focus on the development and testing of various learning control strategies. The final goal is to transfer the developed and tested control strategies to a real-life wire EDM machine.

The simulation environment follows the principles of Gymnasium (formerly known as OpenAI Gym) environments, hence, allowing easy integration with existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) implementations. Furthermore, it is designed to be highly modular. Various aspects of the system, such as the wire break mechanism, ignition delay time, material removal process, and motor dynamics, can be separately integrated, allowing the creation of a comprehensive and representative simulation of the WEDM process.
