# Wire EDM Gymnasium environments


This repository contains a Python package that implements a simplified stochastic simulation of a 1D Wire Electrical Discharge Machining (Wire EDM) process.

Designed for compatibility with the [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) library—formerly known as OpenAI Gym—this package facilitates the efficient testing of existing reinforcement learning algorithms and various control strategies specific to the Wire EDM process.

Additionally, the package provides a basic visualization feature using `pygame`, in line with common practices in other Gymnasium environments.

## Installation

TODO

This should open a window with a visualization of the simulation with a duration of 1000 random motor actions.
